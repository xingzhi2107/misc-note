I will provide you with information about the task and the prefix for the task code, and I would like you to generate an appropriate commit message using the conventional commit format, with title and message body.

- clean up props to make render RichEditorToolBar simply
- migrate pick goods action
- migrate insert br card action
- implement insert poll card action
"
